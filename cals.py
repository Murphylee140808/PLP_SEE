# 🎉 Welcome to the Fun Calculator! 🎉
# We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 😎

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimals too. Fancy, right? ✨
number1 = float(input("Enter ur Desired Number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
# Same trick here—using 'float()' for decimal magic! 🧙‍♂️
number2 = float(input("Still Enter the number wey u like: "))

# Step 3: Time to do some math! 🧠 Let's compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# Add the two numbers (Yay! Addition is the first step to fun!) ➕
join_result = number1 + number2
print(f"The result of my two number:")
print(f"sum: {join_result}") #  ➕ 

# Subtract the second number from the first (Negative vibes, but necessary! 😜) ➖
remove_result = number1 - number2
print(f"Difference: {remove_result}")
